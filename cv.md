## Introduction:

I am 22 years old, I moved from Minsk to Wroclaw and with the help of the rss school I plan to get as much knowledge as possible for subsequent employment. The principle of my life is self-development, improvement of skills and eternal positivity. I have 2 years of experience teaching biology, but my soul prompted me to change fields of activity. Of my strengths, I would single out perseverance, perseverance, enthusiasm.
